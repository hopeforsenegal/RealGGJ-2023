## Issues
So far if the game boots up it should be playable to completion. Here are some general feedback the game has gotten otherwise that I am listing here for safe keeping (or potential future)

* Fix the game showing the plots as empty right before the game restarts (Visual timing fix)
* Theres a bug where you can go to sleep immediately after collecting all the plants causing you to sleep extra times (This is fine since it fixes itself eventually)
* Could address some usability issues by granny talking after 60 seconds of no actions (Non-Gamer usability fix)
